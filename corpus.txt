The suspension of navigation through the Suez Canal has created an atmosphere of uncertainty 
No one knows exactly when things will go back to normal 
The canal is congested 
Dozens of ships are waiting to resume their journeys
Experts say that the salvage efforts might work when the tides gets stronger early next week
If attempts to free the ship fail, one of the options would be to unload part of its cargo
But that would take a long time too
